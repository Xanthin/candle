candles_int
=======================

It´s a fork of Dan Duncombe´s Simply Candles Mod [candle] (https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?id=5991), 
modified just to make it posiible to translate descriptions with kaeza´s Internationalization 
Library [intllib] (https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?id=4929).
For now, there is just the german translation available but every one can use the template.txt 
to make his own transaltion.
The texture directory is missing cause I don´t have the github client installed 
(till I upgrade my windows to a newer version) and so I think I can´t upload, just type text.
